# K8s-stuff
Various useful homebrewed yaml and builds.
Nothing fancy, so far.

- adding-roles-to-users (exercise to define certain RBAC for given users)
- longhorn (NodePort longhorn deployment)
- metrics-server (basic metrics for K8s HPA)
- monitoring (Prometheus & Grafana deployment)
- nginx-ingress (my workout on deploying local ingress)
- wordpress (some database, PVC-PV exercise, longhorn tests)
