# Kubernetes Metrics Server

## User guide

You can find the user guide in
[the official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/resource-metrics-pipeline/).

In order to deploy metrics-server in your cluster run the following command from
the top-level directory of this repository:

```console
# Kubernetes > 1.8
$ kubectl create -f deploy/1.8+/
```

You can also use this helm chart to deploy the metric-server in your cluster (This isn't supported by the metrics-server maintainers): https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/metrics-server

```console
# deploy the latest metric-server
$ kubectl create -f deploy/1.8+/
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:aggregated-metrics-reader created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/metrics-server:system:auth-delegator created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/metrics-server-auth-reader created
apiservice.apiregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1.metrics.k8s.io created
serviceaccount/metrics-server created
deployment.extensions/metrics-server created
service/metrics-server created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:metrics-server created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:metrics-server created

# edit metric-server deployment to add the flags
# args:
# - --kubelet-insecure-tls
# - --kubelet-preferred-address-types=InternalIP,ExternalIP,Hostname
$ kubectl edit deploy -n kube-system metrics-server
```

## Flags

Metrics Server supports all the standard Kubernetes API server flags, as
well as the standard Kubernetes `glog` logging flags.  The most
commonly-used ones are:

- `--logtostderr`: log to standard error instead of files in the
  container.  You generally want this on.

- `--v=<X>`: set log verbosity.  It's generally a good idea to run a log
  level 1 or 2 unless you're encountering errors.  At log level 10, large
  amounts of diagnostic information will be reported, include API request
  and response bodies, and raw metric results from Kubelet.

- `--secure-port=<port>`: set the secure port.  If you're not running as
  root, you'll want to set this to something other than the default (port
  443).

- `--tls-cert-file`, `--tls-private-key-file`: the serving certificate and
  key files.  If not specified, self-signed certificates will be
  generated, but it's recommended that you use non-self-signed
  certificates in production.

- `--kubelet-certificate-authority`: the path of the CA certificate to use 
  for validate the Kubelet's serving certificates.

Additionally, Metrics Server defines a number of flags for configuring its
behavior:

- `--metric-resolution=<duration>`: the interval at which metrics will be
  scraped from Kubelets (defaults to 60s).

- `--kubelet-insecure-tls`: skip verifying Kubelet CA certificates.  Not
  recommended for production usage, but can be useful in test clusters
  with self-signed Kubelet serving certificates.

- `--kubelet-port`: the port to use to connect to the Kubelet (defaults to
  the default secure Kubelet port, 10250).

- `--kubelet-preferred-address-types`: the order in which to consider
  different Kubelet node address types when connecting to Kubelet.
  Functions similarly to the flag of the same name on the API server.
